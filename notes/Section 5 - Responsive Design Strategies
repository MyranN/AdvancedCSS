What are the strategies?
--------------------------------------------------
There are 2 design strategies, one where a site is designed for the desktop first,
called 'DesktopFirst' and the second is 'MobileFirst', which starts with designing
for a mobile phone. The latter is sometimes preferred because it forces the designer
to remove all unnecessary features that can't fit on the screen.

What are media queries?
--------------------------------------------------
Media queries come in 2 forms. MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH. The MAX-WIDTH query checks
if the current viewport width is less than or equal to some given size. If it is,
then the CSS code within the media query is applied.
Similarly for MIN-WIDTH, if the viewport width is greater or equal to a given size,
then the CSS code is applied.

MAX-WIDTH media queries are used for DesktopFirst strategies. MIN-WIDTH is used for
MobileFirst strategies.

Which media queries take precedence?
--------------------------------------------------
Media queries don't add any importance, so code ordering matters. This is why media queries are
defined last.
This is how conflicts are resolved with regards to which CSS is applied for a given size.

How to select breakpoints?
--------------------------------------------------
Breakpoints specify the viewport width size at which media queries are applied. I.e. They
determine when a site is resized/re-adjusted.
The bad way of doing this is to just use the width of common devices (typically Apple) products.
I.e. the smallest breakpoint is the width of an iphone. The medium breakpoints would be the
ipad in vertical and horizontal positions and finally the largest breakpoint could be the macbook.
    phone(600px)---------ipad_vert(900px)--------ipad_hor(1200px)--------macbook(1500px)

A better approach but still not perfect would be to take multiple products, not just Apple and
group the device widths in a logical (similar device widths) such that a breakpoint will cover
multiple devices. E.g. the smallest breakpoint could cover various phones if you know the largest
of the popular phones to be a certain size.

The best approach is to start with either DesktopFirst or MobileFirst strategies and increment/
decrement the width size and see if the site breaks/doesn't look good. If the site breaks, you
add a breakpoint.
