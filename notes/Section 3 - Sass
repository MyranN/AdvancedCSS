How to convert Sass to css?
-------------------------------------------
In webstorm set up a filewatcher by going to:
    File -> Settings -> Tools -> File Watchers

Then add a new file watcher for Sass/Less/SCSS file types. You will then
need to specify the path of the Sass executable from the installation. If you ran
'npm install', then the path will be output to the console. In the arguments box enter the
css file to be created.
E.g.
    program: C:\Program Files\Git\usr\local\sass.cmd
    args   : --update $FileName$:$FileNameWithoutExtension$.css

The '$FileName' is a variable used by Webstorm for the name of the file it has identified
as a less/sass/scss file. Here we're simply using the same name for the css file.

What are the main features of Sass?
-------------------------------------------
    1. Variables            - Reusable values such as color, font-sizes and spacing etc.
    2. Nesting              - Nest selectors inside of one another
    3. Operators            - Mathematical operations inside CSS
    4. Partials & Imports   - Write CSS in different files and import into one.
    5. Mixins               - Reusable pieces of CSS code
    6. Functions            - Similar to mixins but produce a value that can be used
    7. Extends              - Different selectors inherit declarations that are common to them all
    8. Control Directives   - Use loops and conditionals (mostly used for CSS frameworks)

What are the Sass syntax?
-------------------------------------------
There are two Sass syntax. One is standard Sass and the other is SCSS. The Sass syntax is indentation
sensitive, doesn't use curly braces and doesn't use semi-colons. It is harder to convert from regular
CSS to Sass projects as CSS uses semi-colons, curly braces etc. SCSS is more like CSS.
