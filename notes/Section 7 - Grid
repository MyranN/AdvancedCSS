What is CSS Grid?
--------------------------------------------------
A new module that brings two-dimensional grid systems to CSS.
It replaces float layouts, using less and more readable CSS.
CSS Grid and Flexbox work well together where Flexbox handles the one dimensional layouts.
No need for Bootstrap grid definitions (i.e. column splits etc.)

What is CSS Grid Terminology?
--------------------------------------------------
Like Flexbox, there is first a Grid Container. In order to create a grid container, you first
set the 'display' property of an element to 'grid'. I.e
    display: grid    OR     display: grid-inline

All the direct children of the Grid Container are the Grid Items. The Y-axis defines the column
axis and the X-axis defines the row axis. The axes can't be changed like you can in Flexbox.
The lines that make up the grid are called the grid lines. They separate out the columns and rows
and these are automatically numbered starting from 1.
The actual space between the rows and columns is called the Gutter. The row gutter and the column
gutter can differ in size.
