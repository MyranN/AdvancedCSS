What is Flexbox?
--------------------------------------------------
Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to another in different directions and
orders. The idea behind flexbox is to allow the container to expand and shrink elements to make use of the available
space. Flexbox replaces the float layout with less, more readable and logical code.

How to use Flexbox?
--------------------------------------------------
In order to use Flexbox functionality, you first need a flex container. To create a flex container, simply set
the display property of the element to 'flex'. E.g
    <div style="display: flex">
    </div>

To have a flex container that behaves like an inline element, set the display property to 'flex-inline'.
    <div style="display: flex-inline">
    </div>

Child elements of the flex container are called 'Flex Items'. The direction in which the items are laid out in a flex
container is called the 'Main Axis'. The perpendicular axis to this is called the 'Cross Axis'.

The following container properties can be used to configure a flex box.
Property            Possible Values                             Description
flex-direction:     row|row-reverse|column|column-reverse       Determines the main axis direction of the flex items.
flex-wrap:          nowrap|wrap|wrap-reverse                    Determines if the flex items should wrap on to a new line
justify-content:    flex-start|flex-end|center|space-between    Determines how the flex items should be displayed along
                    |space-around|space-evenly                  the main axis.
align-items:        stretch|flex-start|flex-end|center          Determines how the flex items are displayed along the cross
                    |baseline                                   axis.
align-content:      stretch|flex-start|flex-end|center          Determines how the flex items are displayed along the cross
                    |space-between|space-around                 axis if there are multiple rows of flex items.

The following flex item properties can bbe used to configure a flex box.
Property            Possible Values                             Description
align-self:         auto|stretch|flex-start|flex-end|center     Determines how the item is displayed along the cross axis.
                    |baseline
order:              0 | <integer>                               Determines where the flex item should appear in the container.
flex-grow:          0 | <integer>                               Determines how much the flex item can grow
flex-shrink:        0 | <integer>                               Determines how much the flex item can shrink
flex-basis:         auto | <length>                             Defines the flex item's base width
flex:               [0 0 auto]|[<integer><integer><length>      The shorthand for the above 3 properties in the same order
                                                                i.e. flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>
