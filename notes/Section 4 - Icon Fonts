What is an icon-font?
--------------------------------------------------
An icon font is simply various graphics files for a given icon and the associated css file.
For example, linea.io provide .PNG, .SVG and various other formats. You should avoid
using .PNG files and opt to using .SVG or other vector formats as they scale.
Images such .PNG files don't scale.

They are called icon fonts because they are essentially fonts. Therefore, you can use font
related css to style them such font-size etc.

Where to get icon fonts?
--------------------------------------------------
Icon fonts can be obtained for free from numerous third parties. One common icon-font
provider is:
    www.linea.io

Simply download the entire zip of icon-fonts and include the css file of the required
icons you wish to use in your html. Ensure that you copy the source vector files
that the css file refers to, within your project code.

How to use icon fonts?
--------------------------------------------------
Within a html file, an icon-font is simply attached to a 'holding' element. This
element can be ANY element. It has become convention to use the italics element <i>
for icons. Once you've decided on an element, simply refer to icon-font reference
to identify the class name for a given icon. Then use that class as a class of the
element you chose. For example, below we have attached the linea.io icon-basic-world icon
(where the 'icon-basic-world' class name is identified from the associated reference file).
    <section>
        //Can style icon-fonts with font properties.
        <i style="font-size: 6rem" class="icon-basic-world"></i> //This element will be replaced with icon
    </section>

The element that the icon class is attached to, is then REPLACED by the icon itself.
