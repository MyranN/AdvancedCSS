How to install Node?
-------------------------------------------

Download Node.js from it's respective site.

Node.js is a runtime environment to allow javascript (JS) code to run on the server side. It contains the NPM package
manager which is used to retrieve tools/libraries that 3rd party vendors have created to aid in the development
of websites. Sass, grunt libraries are examples of packages that are available.

How to initialise a project with NPM?
-------------------------------------------

Run the following from your project root directory:
    npm init

This is a helper utility to setup a package.json file for your project. This file can also be created manually in a text
editor. The package.json file outlines dependencies for your project.

There is a distinction between dev dependencies and dependencies. The former is used to aid in the development but is
not actually a part of the project. However, the latter is a part of the project.

To install a package as a dev dependency, run:
    npm install <package> --save-dev

To install a package as a dependency, run:
    npm install <package> --save

To uninstall a package as a dependency/dev-dependency, run:
    npm uninstall <package> --save/--save-dev
