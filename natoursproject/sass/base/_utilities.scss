/*
  _utilities.scss holds utility Sass code to perform certain functionality. It
  belongs to the 'base' directory. Utility classes are very simple classes
  that are to be reused.

  Typically using the !important property is discouraged but for utility sass
  code, it is fine because they should take precedence when used over inherited
  properties.
