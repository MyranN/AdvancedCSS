/*
  main.scss imports other SCSS files based on the 7-1 principle. main.scss acts as
  the 1 which only contains imports while the 7 refers to the seven directories
  that get imported. The directories are:
    1. abstracts  - holds Sass code that does not produce any css output such as
                    functions, mixins and variables etc.
    2. base       - holds Sass code that underpins the entire website and its pages.
                    It literally holds the base Sass code, so the body element, the
                    html element and any univeral Sass code.
    3. components - holds Sass code for components, i.e independent reusable Sass
                    bits of code that can be used anywhere. Each component has it's
                    own file in this directory.
    4. layouts    - holds Sass code related to the layouts of the web pages.
    5. pages      - holds Sass code specific to a particular web page in a website.
                    Each page in the site can have it's own file to contain Sass
                    specific to it.
    6. themes     - holds Sass code related to themes. I.e. a website could have
                    support for multiple themes. A dark theme, light theme etc.
    7. vendors    - holds Sass code from third party vendors such as Bootstrap etc.
