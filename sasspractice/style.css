          taller than the element containing it. You can then specify

    Without Sass, in order to style the list items in an element
    a new selector would be needed. E.g.

        .navigation li {
            //stylings
        }

    However, with Sass, you can nest the css selectors as you would
    the elements themselves. Notice below, that the li element is
    nested inside the .navigation selector. You can confirm by
    looking at the css file that gets compiled from the sass file.

    There's no limit to the nesting. For example in order to select
    the last/first child of an element, you could use the following:

        li: last-child {
            margin: 0;
        }

    With Sass, you can nest the 'last-child' selector in the 'li'
    selector already created, which itself is nested inside the
    'navigation' selector.

      The '&' gets replaced with the selector up until this point.
      In this case, it will be '.navigation li'. The rest is appended
      to give
          '.navigation li: first-child'
      The '&' is required when there should be no space separation
      in the selector. E.g. without the '&', you would have
          '.navigation li :first-child'.
      Note the space between 'li' and ':first-child'. This does
      not work.
